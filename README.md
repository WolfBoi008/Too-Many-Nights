# Archipelago Manual for Too Many Nights
An Archipelago Manual for the FNaF fangame, Too Many Nights.

## Notes
### Unlockable Character Conditions
- Henry: Beat a night as Michael, Elizabeth, Evan, and Cassidy
- Gabriel: Get 2 penalties that affect Freddy
- Jeremy: On night 3 or onward, get a power outage and survive
- Susie: Die to Chica twice in one night, then beat that night
- Fritz: Hold 100 coins or more at once
- Fitzgerald: Beat night 5 while only picking the most-left enemies and penalties
- Sally: Beat a night with Percy Poodle and Rowen Rat at max aggression
- Cawthon: Beat Night 3 as every character
### Other Notes
- Due to the nature of Fitzgerald's RNG-heavy gimmick and no way to do a complete reroll for free, he is excluded from the rule of "can only do nights with characters you've been given".
  - This means it's possible to complete "Beat a Night with x Active" Checks out of logic if you get characters you don't have yet while using him.
- The first night is free and doesn't require a Progressive Night, but every other night does.
- More TBD?
